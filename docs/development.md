# Building from Source

## Understanding Overlays

The custom firmware uses an overlay system to modify the base Snapmaker firmware. Overlays are modular modifications that:

- Add patches to modify existing firmware files
- Copy additional files to the firmware root filesystem
- Run build-time scripts to install components
- Enable features without changing the base firmware source

Each overlay is self-contained and numbered to control application order. This modular approach makes it easy to:
- Enable/disable features by including/excluding overlays
- Maintain different firmware profiles (basic vs extended)
- Add custom modifications without conflicts

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system

The `./dev.sh` script automatically sets up a Debian Trixie ARM64 environment with all required dependencies.

## Quick Start

Build tools and download firmware:

```bash
./dev.sh make tools
./dev.sh make firmware
```

Build basic firmware:

```bash
./dev.sh make build PROFILE=basic OUTPUT_FILE=firmware/U1_basic.bin
```

Build extended firmware:

```bash
./dev.sh make build PROFILE=extended OUTPUT_FILE=firmware/U1_extended.bin
```

Open a shell in the development environment:

```bash
./dev.sh bash
```

## Profiles

The build system supports two profiles:

- `basic` - simple modifications not changing key components of the firmware
- `extended` - extensive modifications changing key components of the firmware

## Overlays

Overlays are organized into categories based on their scope and build profile. Each overlay is numbered to indicate its application order within its category.

### Overlay Categories

- **common/** - Core modifications applied to all firmware profiles (basic and extended)
- **firmware-basic/** - Modifications specific to the basic firmware profile
- **firmware-extended/** - Modifications specific to the extended firmware profile
- **devel/** - Development tools and utilities (only included with DEVEL=1 flag)
- **staging/** - Disabled overlays kept for potential future use

## Build Options

- `basic-devel` or `extended-devel` - Add development overlays from `overlays/devel/` to the selected profile
  - e.g. `./dev.sh make build PROFILE=extended DEVEL=1`

### Devel Profile Features

When running firmware built with the `-devel` profile, additional development tools are available:

**Entware Package Manager**

> The Entware is considered highly untrusted component,
> and might be removed at any point in the future without notice.

The devel profile includes Entware support for installing additional packages. After booting the devel firmware, initialize Entware:

```bash
entware-ctrl init
```

This sets up the Entware environment in `/userdata/extended/entware` and installs the bootstrap packages.

Other entware-ctrl commands:

- `entware-ctrl start` - Activate Entware (mount /opt)
- `entware-ctrl stop` - Deactivate Entware (unmount /opt)
- `entware-ctrl nuke` - Remove Entware installation completely

Once initialized, use `opkg` to install packages from the Entware repository.

### Directory Structure

```text
├── common/                          Core overlays applied to all profiles
├── devel/                           Devel overlays applied to all profiles when `-devel`
└── firmware-${profile}/             Profile-specific firmware overlays
```

### Overlay Structure

Each overlay directory can contain:

- `patches/` - Patch files applied to extracted firmware
- `root/` - Files copied to firmware root filesystem
- `scripts/` - Build-time scripts executed during firmware build
- `pre-scripts/` - Scripts executed before main build process

### Application Order

Overlays are applied in the following order:

1. All overlays from `common/` (in numeric order)
1. Profile-specific overlays from `firmware-${profile}/` (in numeric order)

### Integrating Upstream Klipper Patches

The `20-klipper-patches` overlay in `firmware-extended/` backports upstream Klipper commits. To add new patches:

1. **Download the commit as a patch from GitHub:**
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper/commit/16fc46fe5.patch -O 01_16fc46fe5.patch
   ```
   GitHub serves any commit as a patch by appending `.patch` to the commit URL.

2. **Name with order prefix and commit hash:**
   ```text
   01_16fc46fe5.patch
   02_6d1256ddc.patch
   03_16b4b6b30.patch
   ```

3. **Place in the target path within the overlay:**
   ```text
   overlays/firmware-extended/20-klipper-patches/patches/home/lava/klipper/
   ```
   The `patches/` directory maps to the firmware root, so `patches/home/lava/klipper/` applies patches to `/home/lava/klipper/` where Klipper is installed.

4. **Edit the patch to remove irrelevant hunks:**
   Upstream commits often include `docs/` and config changes that don't apply. Remove those hunks, keeping only the Python code changes in `klippy/`.

5. **Document in the overlay README:**
   Update `20-klipper-patches/README.md` with links to the upstream commits.

└── vars.mk                      Firmware version and kernel configuration
```

## Configuration

Edit `vars.mk` to configure base firmware and kernel.

## Extract Firmware

To extract and examine the base firmware:

```bash
./dev.sh make extract
```

Output: `tmp/extracted/`

## Release Process

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated releases:

1. Changes pushed to `main` trigger a pre-release build
2. Both basic and extended firmwares are built
3. Version is auto-incremented using `scripts/next_version.sh`
4. Release artifacts are published to GitHub Releases

## Tools

### rk2918_tools

- `afptool` - Android firmware package tool
- `img_maker` - Create Rockchip images
- `img_unpack` - Unpack Rockchip images
- `mkkrnlimg` - Create kernel images
