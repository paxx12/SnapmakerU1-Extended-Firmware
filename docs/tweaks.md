# Klipper Tweaks

Advanced experimental tweaks for Klipper stepper motor driver configuration. These settings can **only** be configured via the [Firmware Configuration](firmware_config.md) web interface under **Settings → Tweaks**.

> **Warning**: These are experimental features that modify low-level stepper driver parameters. Use with caution and monitor your printer carefully after enabling.

## TMC AutoTune

Applies optimized stepper motor driver settings for TMC2240 drivers.

**What it does:**
- Optimizes PWM settings for quieter operation
- Configures StallGuard and CoolStep parameters
- Adjusts timing parameters for better heat management
- Fine-tunes driver parameters for improved performance

**Risks:**
- May cause motors to overheat if cooling is insufficient
- Could result in reduced torque or skipped steps under heavy load
- Incorrect settings may affect print quality
- Changes low-level driver parameters that override defaults

**Recommendation:**
- Monitor motor temperatures during first use
- Test with simple prints before production work
- Revert to disabled if you experience issues

**Configuration:**
This feature can **only** be configured via Firmware Configuration web interface. Manual configuration is not supported.

## TMC Reduced Current

Lowers the stepper motor run current from 1.2A to 1.0A for X and Y axes.

**What it does:**
- Reduces X and Y axis motor current to 1.0A
- Lowers motor heat generation
- Results in quieter motor operation

**Risks:**
- May cause skipped steps under heavy load or fast movements
- Could result in layer shifts on demanding prints
- May reduce positioning accuracy under high acceleration

**Recommendation:**
- Monitor print quality after enabling
- Watch for layer shifts or positioning issues
- Disable if you experience motion problems

**Configuration:**
This feature can **only** be configured via Firmware Configuration web interface. Manual configuration is not supported.

## How to Configure

1. Open the printer's web interface (Fluidd or Mainsail)
2. Navigate to **Firmware Config** in the menu
3. Go to **Settings → Tweaks**
4. Select the desired option for each tweak
5. Confirm the warning dialog
6. Klipper will automatically restart to apply changes

Changes take effect immediately after Klipper restarts (no reboot required).

## Technical Details

These tweaks work by adding or removing configuration files from `/oem/printer_data/config/extended/klipper/`:
- `tmc_autotune.cfg` - TMC AutoTune parameters
- `tmc_current.cfg` - Reduced current settings

These files are automatically included by the main printer configuration if present. Manual editing of these files is not recommended as they will be overwritten by the Firmware Configuration interface.
