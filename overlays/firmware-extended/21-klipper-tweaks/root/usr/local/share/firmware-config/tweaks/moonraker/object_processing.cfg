# Enable Object Processing in Moonraker
#
# WARNING: Enabling object processing can cause problems for very large gcode files
# (> 100MB). This feature processes gcode files to extract object information, which
# can result in:
# - Long processing times before a print can start
# - Extended time stuck at 100% in Snapmaker Orca when sending the print
# - High memory usage during file processing
#
# Only enable this if you need adaptive mesh features and are working with
# reasonably-sized gcode files.
#
# IMPORTANT: Enabling 'Exclude Object' in your slicer settings is preferred over this option.
