# TMC Reduced Current Configuration
# This configuration reduces the stepper motor run current for lower heat generation
# and quieter operation.
#
# WARNING: Reduced current may cause skipped steps under heavy load or fast movements.
# Monitor print quality and increase current if you experience layer shifts or other
# motion issues.
