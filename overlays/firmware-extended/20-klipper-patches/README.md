## How patches were generated

These patches were generated from the `snapmaker-lava/snapmaker-klipper` repository
on the `patches-v1.1.0` branch. The commit order and details follow the cherry-pick
sequence documented in `snapmaker-lava/snapmaker-klipper/SUMMARY.md`.

To regenerate patches, use `git format-patch` on each commit from snapmaker-klipper,
excluding docs/ directory changes to keep patches minimal and focused on code changes.

## Formatting of patches

Patches are ordered per SUMMARY.md, stripped of docs/ changes, and minimal amount of
amendments are done to make them as close to upstream as possible.
