# install-helixscreen.sh - Install (or uninstall) HelixScreen on a Snapmaker U1
#                          running paxx12's extended firmware.
#
# HelixScreen (https://helixscreen.org) is a native LVGL touchscreen UI for
# Klipper with a dedicated Snapmaker U1 backend (RFID spool recognition,
# per-slot spool assignment, runout recovery). Installing it replaces the
# stock Snapmaker touchscreen UI until it is uninstalled.
#
# This script wraps the official HelixScreen installer and adds two
# extended-firmware-specific behaviors:
#
#   1. Overlay persistence is required up front (/oem/.debug), like the other
#      add-on recipes - enable it via firmware-config (Settings > System >
#      Overlay Persistence). The official installer would silently create the
#      flag itself; failing fast keeps it an explicit user choice.
#
#   2. Remote Screen restore: HelixScreen's autostart hook replaces
#      /etc/init.d/S99fb-http (the extended firmware's Remote Screen launcher)
#      with a delegate that starts HelixScreen INSTEAD of the fb-http daemon,
#      preserving the original as S99fb-http.stock. That silently breaks
#      http://<printer-ip>/screen/ on the next boot. We start the preserved
#      stock launcher right after install; at boot the same is done by
#      /etc/init.d/S99fb-http-restore (shipped in the firmware image by the
#      St0rmingBr4in mod overlay). S99fb-http.stock itself no-ops unless
#      Remote Screen is enabled in extended2.cfg, so this is always safe.
#
# What the official installer does on the U1 (for reference):
#   - installs to /userdata/helixscreen/
#   - hooks boot via overlay copies of S99screen / S99fb-http /
#     S99input-event-daemon
#   - disables the stock UI binary with `chmod a-x /usr/bin/gui` (the stock
#     supervisor lmd keeps trying to respawn it and gives up; harmless)
#
# Uninstall restores the stock init scripts and the /usr/bin/gui exec bit,
# but the stock UI only reappears after a reboot.
#
# Idempotent: rerunning updates HelixScreen to the latest release.
#
# Usage: ssh root@<printer-ip> 'sh -s' < install-helixscreen.sh
#        install-helixscreen.sh [--uninstall]

# /dev/fb0 updates invisibly. helix-restore-panel-scanout waits for
# helix-screen to come up and for the splash to exit (restoring any earlier
# loses the race to the splash's page flips), then mode-sets /dev/fb0 back
# onto the panel. (S99fb-http-restore repeats this at every boot.)
